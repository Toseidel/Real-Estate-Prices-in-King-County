# Real-Estate-Prices-in-King-County

This document will cover an extensive exploratory data analysis using the King County Real Estate dataset. 
The analysis addresses 3 major goals: 

**Goal 1**:
Find the most interesting house offers for an imaginary client, a wealthy business man, in search for a spacius place to host ravish uptown parties. Since money is not a constraint, he has his eyes only on the most exclusive properties in the Seattle area. The client has a particular appetite for modern buildings and a waterfront view is a must. There is should be no less than 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. The living_sqm space is to be maximized and more important than purchase price.

**Goal 2**:
Construct a linear regression model to predict the housing prices using a selection of the most relevant features. The aim is to achieve an r-square above 0.7. 

**Goal 3**:
Optimize the model accuracy to minimize the RMSE

Throughout the analysis, I will closely follow the typical data science lifecycle and cover all areas from data mining, to data cleaning, feature engineering, modelling up to the visualization.
